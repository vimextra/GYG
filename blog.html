                        <p class="blog-author"><strong>By Sarah Martinez, Electrical Mentor</strong></p>
                        <p>When Maria first walked into our workshop, she barely made eye contact and spoke in whispers. Like many of our mentees, she doubted her ability to succeed in a traditionally male-dominated field. Today, she's a confident electrician running her own small business.</p>
                        <p>The transformation didn't happen overnight. It started with small victories â€” successfully wiring her first outlet, understanding complex circuit diagrams, and most importantly, realizing that her questions weren't "stupid" but signs of genuine curiosity...</p>

                        <p class="blog-author"><strong>By Jake Thompson, Program Graduate & Current Mentor</strong></p>
                        <p>Three years ago, I was struggling to find direction after dropping out of college. I felt like a failure, bouncing between dead-end jobs with no real skills or purpose. That's when my cousin told me about Grow Your Greatness.</p>
                        <p>I'll be honest â€” I was skeptical. Another program promising to "change my life"? But something was different here. My mentor, Carlos, didn't just teach me plumbing; he believed in me when I didn't believe in myself...</p>

                        <p>There's never been a better time to enter the skilled trades. While everyone's talking about automation replacing jobs, the reality is that skilled tradespeople are more in demand than ever. Here's what the data tells us...</p>
                        <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 15% growth in construction trades through 2031 â€” much faster than average. But it's not just about quantity; it's about quality opportunities with real earning potential...</p>

                        <p>His fellow mentees stayed after hours to practice with him. Alumni came back to share their experiences. Local business owners offered encouragement and job opportunities. This is what sets us apart...</p>
